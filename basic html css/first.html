        <h2> Intro </h2>
        <section>
            <p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek
                φολῐ́ς,
                "horny scale").Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales, similar in material to fingernails and
                toenails,
                covering their skin;
                they are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on
                the
                species. Pangolins are nocturnal,
                and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They
                tend
                to
                be solitary animals, meeting only
                to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years.
                Pangolins superficially resemble armadillos, though the two are not closely related; they have merely
                undergone
                convergent evolution.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pangolins have large, protective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin">Keratin</a> scales covering
            their skin; they are the only known mammals with this
            feature raise for about two yearsPangolins can emit a noxious-smelling chemical from glands near the anus,
            similar to the spray of a skunk.[29] They have short legs,
            with sharp claws which they use for burrowing into ant and termite mounds and for climbing.[30].</p>

        <h2>Poaching</h2>
        <p>Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese traditional
            medicine)
            and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of
        </p>
        <p>three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are listed as endangered and two
            (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened
            Species
            of the International
            Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
